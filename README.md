# Animal Image Classification API 🐱🐶🐍

A deep learning project for classifying animal images (cat, dog, snake) using PyTorch and FastAPI.  
This repository provides a REST API for image prediction, supports Docker deployment, and includes training utilities.

---

## Features

- **Image classification** for cats, dogs, and snakes
- **REST API** built with FastAPI
- **PyTorch** model training and inference
- **Docker** support for easy deployment
- **Data augmentation** and balanced dataset splitting


train.ipynb -> train&test model / accuracy
model.py -> Model Architecture Definition  and helper_fucntion for load_model, preprocess_input ,postprocess_output
main.py -> FastAPI server and predicted API
